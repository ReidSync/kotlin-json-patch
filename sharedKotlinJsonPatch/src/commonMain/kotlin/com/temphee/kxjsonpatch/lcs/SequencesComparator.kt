/**
 * This class allows to compare two objects sequences.
 *
 *
 * The two sequences can hold any object type, as only the `equals`
 * method is used to compare the elements of the sequences. It is guaranteed
 * that the comparisons will always be done as `o1.equals(o2)` where
 * `o1` belongs to the first sequence and `o2` belongs to
 * the second sequence. This can be important if subclassing is used for some
 * elements in the first sequence and the `equals` method is
 * specialized.
 *
 *
 * Comparison can be seen from two points of view: either as giving the smallest
 * modification allowing to transform the first sequence into the second one, or
 * as giving the longest sequence which is a subsequence of both initial
 * sequences. The `equals` method is used to compare objects, so any
 * object can be put into sequences. Modifications include deleting, inserting
 * or keeping one object, starting from the beginning of the first sequence.
 *
 *
 * This class implements the comparison algorithm, which is the very efficient
 * algorithm from Eugene W. Myers
 * [
 * An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/courses/dd/papers/diff.ps). This algorithm produces
 * the shortest possible
 * [edit script][EditScript]
 * containing all the
 * [commands][EditCommand]
 * needed to transform the first sequence into the second one.
