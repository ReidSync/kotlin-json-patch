/**
 * Abstract base class for all commands used to transform an objects sequence
 * into another one.
 *
 *
 * When two objects sequences are compared through the
 * [SequencesComparator.getScript] method,
 * the result is provided has a [script][EditScript] containing the commands
 * that progressively transform the first sequence into the second one.
 *
 *
 * There are only three types of commands, all of which are subclasses of this
 * abstract class. Each command is associated with one object belonging to at
 * least one of the sequences. These commands are [ InsertCommand][InsertCommand] which correspond to an object of the second sequence being
 * inserted into the first sequence, [DeleteCommand] which
 * correspond to an object of the first sequence being removed and
 * [KeepCommand] which correspond to an object of the first
 * sequence which `equals` an object in the second sequence. It is
 * guaranteed that comparison is always performed this way (i.e. the
 * `equals` method of the object from the first sequence is used and
 * the object passed as an argument comes from the second sequence) ; this can
 * be important if subclassing is used for some elements in the first sequence
 * and the `equals` method is specialized.
